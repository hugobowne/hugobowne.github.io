                <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">

                    <h2 class="section-heading">statistics, data analysis, data science</h2>
                    <p class="text-light">by trade, i am a mathematician and computational biologist who has inevitably become seriously 		involved in the methods of statistical inference and data analysis. much of my current work in the lab of jonathon howard at 		yale university invovles consulting with experimentalists on best statistical practices & methodologies. i aim to provide 		experimentalists with a statistical and data analytic framework, whereby they may view the processes of statistical inference 		as not 	merely necessary evils that occur between doing experiments and publishing results, but as intuitive ways of thinking 		that can help with all steps of the scientific process, from exploratory research to the posing of well-formed scientific 		questions to experimental design. Straight off the bat, experimentalists can think about questions such as ‘how many data 		points will i need to find a statistically significant result?’ and ‘what type of experimental set-up is required to retrieve 		the signal-to-noise ratio necessary to validate anticipated results?’</p>

		<p class="text-light">to this end, i have taught formal workshops on statistical inference for experimentalists at the max 		planck institute for cell biology and genetics, dresden, and at yale university, new haven, along with more informal 			workshops conducted in locations such as the marine biology laboratory, woods hole. in fall, 2015, i taught a ’practical 		statistics for experimentalists’ workshop in the molecular biophysics & biochemistry department (mb&b) at yale university to 		15 graduate students and postdocs from both mb&b and yale medical school. there were 4 workshops in total: the 1st on (click 		on links for workshop notes) <a href=Workshops/Workshop_I.html>plotting data, summary statistics and the central limit 			theorem</a>, the 2nd on <a href=Workshops/Workshop_II.html>statistical hypothesis testing</a>, the 3rd on <a href=Workshops/		Workshop_III.html>model fitting and model selection (mle, linear regression, nonlinear least squares)</a> and the 4th on 		<a href=Workshops/Workshop_IV.html>bayesian inference.</a></p>
		<h3>(data) scientific reproducibility</h3>
		<p class="text-light">statistical literacy is a huge challenge for both the natural & social sciences. another massive 	challenge is <i>reproducibility</i>. ioannidis’ 2005 paper 
<a href=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124><i>why most published research findings are false</i></a> gave a precise formalism to a serious, endemic problem facing scientific communities in all fields. i am interested in and committed to the development of robust statistical frameworks that will contribute to the reproducibility of scientific results as a whole, in contrast to the messy toolbox of statistics that is currently used in high and low-impact journals alike. papers such as cummings’ 2013
<a href=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/25/1/7><i>the new statistics: why and how</i></a>
 are a great a place to start, for those interested. This issue of <i>reproducibility</i> is also one that will plague data science and big data and so is worth investing in at all levels of society, not merely the academic.
